# This routing.yml file makes both the fapi example description page and the
# included sample forms available at specific URL's on your site. A route
# maps a URL path to a controller. For page controllers it defines the
# function or method that will be called when the page is accessed.  For form
# controllers the content is determined by the buildForm method defined by the
# form controller implementation.

# Access to these paths is restricted to users with the permission
# 'access content'. This is notated as _permission: 'access content'.

# Menu items corresponding to these URLs are defined separately in the
# form_api_example.links.menu.yml file.
